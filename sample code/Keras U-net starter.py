# Intro
Hello! This rather quick and dirty kernel shows how to get started on segmenting nuclei using a neural network in Keras. 

The architecture used is the so-called [U-Net](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597), which is very common for image segmentation problems such as this. I believe they also have a tendency to work quite well even on small datasets.

Let's get started importing everything we need!

# Create our Keras metric

Now we try to define the *mean average precision at different intersection over union (IoU) thresholds* metric in Keras. TensorFlow has a mean IoU metric, but it doesn't have any native support for the mean over multiple thresholds, so I tried to implement this. **I'm by no means certain that this implementation is correct, though!** Any assistance in verifying this would be most welcome! 

*Update: This implementation is most definitely not correct due to the very large discrepancy between the results reported here and the LB results. It also seems to just increase over time no matter what when you train ... *

Next we fit the model on the training data, using a validation split of 0.1. We use a small batch size because we have so little data.

I won't do it here to make things a bit more reproducible (although it's very likely that your results will be different anyway).
